# Timeline of the creation of this project

Here is a small summary of all the major steps made to advance the project:

  -  Firstly, being able to use the Raspberry Pi 3 and ROS is needed  
  -  Then downloading Arduino has been done and the configuration of it in order to locate of all the packages  
  -  Moreover, all the sensors have been studied to become familiar with them  
  -  Being able to see all the datas from the sensors on the Raspberry Pi 3 is mandatory  
  -  Thus, the first filtering algorith were used to calibrate the sensors  
  -  After this, simple algorithm were created for station keeping or line following for instance
